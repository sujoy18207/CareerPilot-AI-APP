### 1.2 Project Initialization
- [x] Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript:
  ```bash
  npx -y create-next-app@latest ./ --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir=false --import-alias="@/*"
  ```
- [x] Install core dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install mongoose next-auth@beta bcryptjs openai pdf-parse formidable
  npm install -D @types/bcryptjs @types/formidable
  ```
- [x] Initialize shadcn/ui:
  ```bash
  npx -y shadcn@latest init
  ```
- [x] Install essential shadcn/ui components:
  ```bash
  npx -y shadcn@latest add button card input label form dialog sheet avatar badge progress tabs separator toast dropdown-menu
  ```
- [x] Setup project structure (create all directories):
  ```
  mkdir -p app/(auth)/login app/(auth)/register
  mkdir -p app/(dashboard)/career app/(dashboard)/roadmap app/(dashboard)/courses
  mkdir -p app/(dashboard)/pdf app/(dashboard)/tutor app/(dashboard)/dashboard
  mkdir -p app/api/auth/register app/api/auth/\[...nextauth\]
