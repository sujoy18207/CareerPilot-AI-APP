Welcome to the official repository for **Career Pilot**, an AI-powered career guidance and personalized learning assistant developed by **Career Wallah** for the **Brainware AI Hackathon 2026**.

Career Pilot reduces uncertainty in career planning for students. It combines career assessment, generated roadmaps, live course and job discovery, document-aware tutoring, resume building, HackerRank-inspired resume scoring, and progress tracking in one responsive platform.

The interface uses a light-first neo-brutalist design, supports dark mode, includes a user-selectable accent color, responsive hamburger navigation, resilient image fallbacks, and visible loading states during route transitions and data fetches.
